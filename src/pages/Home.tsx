        Plus? what you mean by plus? Well... It just consists in the classic one, is a 3x3 grid and the first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. But in this version, once 6 marks are placed, the first one is removed, so you have to be careful with your strategy.
